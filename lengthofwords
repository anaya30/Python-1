'''Q.2.1.Write a Python program using function concept that maps list of words into a list of integers
representing the lengths of the corresponding words.
Hint: If a list [ ab,cde,erty] is passed on to the python function output should come as [2,3,4]
Here 2,3 and 4 are the lengths of the words in the list.'''

def word_to_integer(list_of_words):
    integer_list=[]
    for i in list_of_words:
        integer_list.append(len(i))
    return integer_list
print(word_to_integer(['apple','orange','kiwi','oat']))

Solution: [5, 6, 4, 3]
